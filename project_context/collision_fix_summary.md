# Collision Detection Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The previous implementation with 4px MINIMUM_GAP was causing:
- Visual gaps between lockers that should be adjacent
- 16 collision detections for a single move operation
- Poor user experience with unexpected spacing

## Root Cause
The collision detection was using the full bounds (including selection outline) instead of just the locker body bounds, and enforcing a 4px minimum gap that created visual separation.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Reverted MINIMUM_GAP to 0**: Allows locker bodies to be visually adjacent
2. **Updated collision logic**: Changed from `overlapX > -MINIMUM_GAP` to `overlapX > MINIMUM_GAP` (true overlap only)
3. **Fixed snapping behavior**: Snap points now align locker bodies to touch without gaps

## Technical Changes
- File: `/frontend/src/pages/LockerPlacementFigma.vue`
- Lines modified: 3716-3717, 3862, 3891, 3910, 3932, 3948, 3996-3997
- All MINIMUM_GAP values set to 0 for visual adjacency
- Collision detection now only triggers on actual overlap (>0px)

## Expected Results
- Lockers can be placed adjacent to each other with no visual gap
- Selection outlines may overlap (this is expected and OK)
- Consistent, predictable collision behavior
- Single collision detection per move operation
- Better user experience with proper snapping

## Testing Notes
- Verify lockers snap together without gaps
- Confirm collision detection prevents true overlap
- Check that multi-select drag maintains relative positions
- Test rotation with adjacent lockers
