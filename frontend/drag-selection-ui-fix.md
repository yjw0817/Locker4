# Drag Selection UI Fix

## Problem
After drag selection of multiple lockers, the selection UI buttons (rotate, delete, etc.) don't appear immediately. Users had to click again to make the buttons visible.

## Root Cause
The `showSelectionUI` flag wasn't being set to `true` after drag selection completed, even though lockers were properly selected.

## Solution
Added `showSelectionUI.value = true` in two critical locations:

### 1. In updateSelectionInRectangle function (line 1162)
```javascript
if (selectedLockerIds.value.size > 0) {
  const firstId = Array.from(selectedLockerIds.value)[0]
  selectedLocker.value = currentLockers.value.find(l => l.id === firstId)
  // Show selection UI immediately when lockers are selected
  showSelectionUI.value = true  // ← Added this line
}
```

### 2. In drag end handler (line 1086)
```javascript
if (dragDistance > dragThreshold) {
  updateSelectionInRectangle()
  
  // Set flag to prevent immediate deselection
  dragSelectionJustFinished.value = true
  
  // Ensure selection UI is shown after drag selection
  if (selectedLockerIds.value.size > 0) {
    showSelectionUI.value = true  // ← Added this line
  }
}
```

## Test Results ✅
- Drag select multiple lockers → UI buttons appear immediately
- No need for additional click after drag selection
- Selection UI shows consistently for both single and multiple selections
- Works with all drag directions and selection sizes

## Benefits
1. **Better UX**: Immediate visual feedback after selection
2. **Consistency**: Same behavior as click selection
3. **Efficiency**: Users can immediately perform actions without extra clicks
