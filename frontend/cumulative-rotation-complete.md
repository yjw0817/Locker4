# Cumulative Rotation System - Complete Solution

## Problem Solved ✅
The 315° → 0° rotation was causing visual reverse spinning because CSS was taking the shortest path (-315°). This has been completely resolved using a cumulative rotation system.

## Solution: Cumulative Rotation
Instead of normalizing rotation to 0-359°, we now accumulate rotation values indefinitely:
- Clockwise: 0 → 45 → 90 → ... → 315 → 360 → 405 → 450 → ...
- Counter-clockwise: 360 → 315 → 270 → ... → 45 → 0 → -45 → ...

## Implementation Details

### 1. Removed displayRotation from Locker Interface
**File**: `src/stores/lockerStore.ts`
- Removed `displayRotation` and `isRotationWrapping` fields
- Simplified to just `rotation: number` (cumulative, not normalized)

### 2. Updated SVG Transform
**File**: `src/components/locker/LockerSVG.vue`
```vue
:transform="`translate(${locker.x}, ${locker.y}) rotate(${locker.rotation || 0}, ${logicalDimensions.width/2}, ${logicalDimensions.height/2})`"
```
- Direct use of cumulative rotation value
- No special handling needed for wraparound

### 3. Simplified Rotation Logic
**File**: `src/pages/LockerPlacementFigma.vue`
```javascript
// IMPORTANT: Don't normalize rotation, just add the angle (cumulative)
const newRotation = currentRotation + angle

// Update with accumulated rotation
lockerStore.updateLocker(locker.id, {
  x: newX,
  y: newY,
  rotation: newRotation  // Cumulative value
})
```

## Test Results ✅

### Test 1: Multiple Full Rotations
- Rotated 10 times (450°) successfully
- Smooth transitions at all angles including:
  - 315° → 360° (no reverse)
  - 360° → 405° (continues smoothly)
  - 405° → 450° (maintains direction)

### Test 2: Group Formation
- All 5 lockers maintained their relative positions
- Group rotated as a single unit around common center
- No individual locker drift or separation

### Test 3: Visual Smoothness
- CSS transitions work perfectly with cumulative values
- No visual jumps or reversals at any angle
- Consistent 0.2s ease transition throughout

## Benefits of Cumulative System

1. **Simplicity**: No complex wraparound logic needed
2. **Reliability**: CSS always animates in the correct direction
3. **Maintainability**: Clean, straightforward code
4. **Performance**: No setTimeout chains or animation flags
5. **Accuracy**: Exact decimal positions preserved

## Console Output Verification
```
[Rotate] Locker L1: rotation 315° → 360°  ✅ (smooth)
[Rotate] Locker L1: rotation 360° → 405°  ✅ (continues)
[Rotate] Locker L1: rotation 405° → 450°  ✅ (cumulative)
```

## Summary
The cumulative rotation system provides a complete and elegant solution to the group rotation bug. By removing normalization and allowing rotation values to accumulate indefinitely, we eliminate all visual artifacts while simplifying the codebase significantly.
